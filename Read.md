## General information
As part of a Consumer Loan Company, which specializes in lending a variety of loans, we need to identify patterns that indicate that loans may be Automatic. When a company receives a loan application, it must decide on the loan approval based on the applicant profile. This decision is associated with 2 types of risks;

a. If the applicant is able to repay the loan, failure to approve the loan will result in the loss of the company;
b. Should the applicant fail to repay the loan, approving the loan application will result in a loss.

The data provided below contains information about loan applicants in the past and whether they ‘made a mistake’ or not. We need to create an EDA to understand how consumer and credit providers apply the decision. In other words, the company wants to understand the driving characteristics (or driver dynamics) after a loan error, i.e. the dynamics which are strong automation indicators. The Company may use this information for its portfolio and risk assessment.
